Quick note how to develop and deploy model Machine Learning
## What is Machine Learning?
- Essentially, ML is a thing-labeler.
- mapping between some input and some known output without explicitly programmed.

## Build from scratch
### Task for ML Enginering
- define problem(output)
- gather data
- set evaluation protocal
- prepare the data (important most)
- split data to train and test
- choose algorithm to train
- develop benchmark model
- get the best performance model

### problem common ML
- data cleaning, 
- model training 
- algorithm optimisation

## first model
